# My Portfolio

This assignment was to create a portofolio based on the mockup image provided in the assignment descritpion. 

My website was brokedn up into four main sections:

1. Header

    This section was created by an H1 tag an an unordered list under the nav tags. When any items in the unordered list are cliked they will link to a section of the page with the exception of the resume link. This link will take you to a pdf of my resume. 

2. Welcome Bar

    This section was created by a section and article tag that span the width of the screen separating the header from the rest of the page by using a gradient background from blue to orange. 

3. About Me

    This section is comprised of a link, a paragrah and an image of me. Each of these items will stack onto each other if the page is minimized. 

4. Work

    This section is designed to highligh work that I've completed. As I haven't finished any projetcs worth showing off just yet, these boxes don't link to anyting yet. Hovering over the boxes will change their color however. 

5. Contact Me

    This section is the footer of the page contaning three links to my GitHub, my Twitter and my LinkedIn.
